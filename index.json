Behavioral change is often ignored in epidemic modeling efforts, making these models less useful than they could be. We address this by introducing a novel class of data-driven epidemic models which characterize and accurately estimate behavioral change. Our proposed model allows time-varying transmission to be captured by the level of 'alarm' in the population, with alarm specified as a function of the past epidemic trajectory. We investigate the estimability of the population alarm across a wide range of scenarios, applying both parametric functions and non-parametric functions using splines and Gaussian processes. The model is set in the data-augmented Bayesian framework to allow estimation on partially observed epidemic data. The benefit and utility of the proposed approach is illustrated through applications to data from real epidemics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bayesian modeling of dynamic behavioral change during an epidemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marit M.

Our objective was to estimate within-herd transmission across adult dairy cows, youngstock and calves. Results from 3 tests (PCR, ELISA, and culture) per cow and 2 tests (PCR and ELISA) per youngstock and calf were utilized in an age-stratified Susceptible-Infected-Removed/Recovered (SIR) model to estimate within-herd transmission parameters, pathways, and potential effects of farm management practices. A cohort of adult cows, youngstock and calves on 20 Dutch dairy farms with a clinical outbreak of M. bovis in adult cows were sampled, with collection of blood, conjunctival fluid and milk from cows, and blood and conjunctival fluid from calves and youngstock, 5 times over a timespan of 12 wk. Any individual with at least 1 positive laboratory test was considered M. bovis-positive. Transmission dynamics were modeled using an age-stratified SIR model featuring 3 age strata. Associations with farm management practices were explored using Fisher's Exact tests and Poisson regression. Estimated transmission parameters were highly variable among herds and cattle-age groups. Notably, transmission from cows to cows, youngstock, or to calves was associated with R-values ranging from 1.0 to 80 secondarily infected cows per herd, 1.2 to 38 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, and 0.1 to 91 secondarily infected calves per herd, respectively. In case of transmission from youngstock to youngstock, calves or to cows, R-values were 0.7 to 96 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, 1.1 to 76 secondarily infected calves per herd, and 0.1 to 107 secondarily infected cows per herd. For transmission from calves to calves, youngstock or to cows, R-values were 0.5 to 60 secondarily infected calves per herd, 1.1 to 41 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, and 0.1 to 47 secondarily infected cows per herd. Among on-farm transmission pathways, cow-to-youngstock, cow-to-calf and cow-to-cow were identified as most significant contributors, with calf-to-calf and calf-to-youngstock also having noteworthy roles. Youngstock-to-youngstock was also implicated, albeit to a lesser extent. Whereas the primary focus was a clinical outbreak of M. bovis among adult dairy cows, it was evident that transmission extended to calves and youngstock, contributing to overall spread. Factors influencing transmission and specific transmission pathways were associated with internal biosecurity (separate caretakers for various age groups, number of people involved), external biosecurity (contractors, external employees), as well as indirect transmission routes (number of feed and water stations).","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Within-herd transmission of Mycoplasma bovis infections after initial detection in dairy cows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clarissa Shaw","Caitlin Ward","Alexander Williams","Kyuri Lee","Keela Herr"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689724800,"objectID":"7dc266caf7fc9d0a8baad61d39364dae","permalink":"https://ceward18.github.io/publication/elderspeak_roc/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/elderspeak_roc/","section":"publication","summary":" **Background and Objectives**\n\nRejection of care is common in hospitalized persons living with dementia. However, distinguishing between rejection of care behaviors related to care practices or other causes such as pain or delirium is challenging. The purpose of this study is to further understand the relationship between rejection of care and pain and delirium in hospitalized patients with dementia by identifying which rejection of care behaviors are associated with pain and delirium.\n\n**Research Design and Methods**\n\nCare encounters between hospitalized patients with dementia (n=16) and nursing staff (n=53) were observed on 88 separate occasions across 35 days. Rejection of care was measured using the 13 behaviors from the Resistiveness to Care Scale. Pain and delirium severity were measured using a variety of scales including the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD), Checklist of Nonverbal Pain Indicators (CNPI), and numeric rating scale for pain severity and the Confusion Assessment Method—Severity (CAM-S) short form and Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS) for delirium severity. Linear-mixed-modeling was used to determine the relationship between rejection of care behaviors and pain and delirium severity for each measure.\n\n**Results**\n\n48.9% of the observations included rejection of care, 49.9% included a patient in pain, and 12.5% included a patient with delirium. Cry, push away, scream/yell, and turn away indicated a higher pain severity across pain measures. No rejection of care behaviors were found to indicate delirium severity.\n\n**Discussion and Implications**\n\nCertain rejection of care behaviors may be helpful in identifying pain in hospitalized patients with dementia suggesting that caregivers should be cognizant of pain when these rejection of care behaviors are present.

A significant challenge in fitting Bayesian compartmental models lies in the need to estimate the duration of the infectious period, based on limited data providing only symptom onset date or another proxy for the start of infectiousness. Commonly, the exponential distribution is used to describe the infectious duration, an overly simplistic approach, which is not biologically plausible. More flexible distributions can be used, but parameter identifiability and computational cost can worsen for moderately sized or large epidemics. In this article, we present a novel approach, which considers a curve of transmissibility over a fixed infectious duration. The incorporation of infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmissibility, which decays to zero during the infectious period, is biologically reasonable for many viral infections and fixing the length of the infectious period eases computational complexity in model fitting. Through simulation, we evaluate different functional forms of IDD transmissibility curves and show that the proposed approach offers improved estimation of the time-varying reproductive number. We illustrate the benefit of our approach through a new analysis of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Incorporating infectious duration-dependent transmission into Bayesian epidemic models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tessa Heeran","Caitlin Ward","Daniel Sewell","Sato Ashida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666051200,"objectID":"dddc9718d1602a3dcfdc1ad5087b01e3","permalink":"https://ceward18.github.io/publication/care_coordination_networks/","publishdate":"2022-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/care_coordination_networks/","section":"publication","summary":" **Background**\n\nAccountable Communities of Health (ACH) models have been popularized through Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) grants, including the State Innovation Model (SIM), to encourage the development of community-based coalitions across medical, public health, and social service delivery systems.

Factors associated with sustainable connections between organizations included the strength of relationships and the type of collaboration, namely data sharing and resource sharing. Leadership roles designated by the ACH structure were associated with stimulating connections during the grant, but not with sustainment. Network measures of density and transitivity, which peaked during the grant period (compared to pre- and post-grant networks), further implied possible attrition of the ACH intervention effects without incentive to maintain collaborations.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nMulti-sector care coordination networks were established, but our findings suggest depreciation of ACH intervention momentum and structure without incentive to maintain collaborations beyond the three-year duration of the grant.

Little is known about the presence of elderspeak communication in hospitals in the United States. Understanding this phenomenon in the hospital setting is needed in order to improve hospital dementia care. The purpose of the Nurse Talk study was to (1) describe attributes of elderspeak use in hospital dementia care and to (2) determine what characteristics are associated with nursing staff use of elderspeak communication with hospitalized patients with dementia. A cross-sectional observational study design was used to collect and analyze audio-recordings of nursing staff during care for hospitalized patients with dementia. Three hospital units in one Midwestern university hospital in the United States. A convenience sample of 53 staff nurses and nursing assistants that provided direct care to 16 patients with mild or more severe dementia recruited from October 2019 through mid-March 2020. Eighty-eight care encounters were audio-recorded and coded for elderspeak communication using the Iowa Coding of Elderspeak scheme to determine the frequency and characteristics of elderspeak communication. A linear mixed effects model was used to determine what characteristics were associated with elderspeak and the frequency of elderspeak use by nursing staff to hospitalized patients with dementia. Over a quarter (28.7%) of all nursing staff speech directed towards patients with dementia constituted elderspeak and nearly all (96.6%) care encounters included some elderspeak. Particularly common attributes of elderspeak were minimizing words and mitigating expressions, childish terms and phrases, and collective pronoun substitution. A statistically significant interaction was identified between staff role and age (95% CI: [-0.02, -0.00], p=.008) in predicting the frequency of elderspeak use, indicating that elderspeak was used more often by older staff nurses, whereas the age of nursing assistants remained constant across elderspeak use. Statically significant effects for delirium and length of stay were also demonstrated. Elderspeak use was 12.5% higher with patients with delirium (95% CI: [0.02, 0.23], p=.025) and increased 1.5% for each additional day the patient with dementia was hospitalized (95% CI: [0.00, 0.03], p=.035). Elderspeak is present and pervasive in the acute care setting. Interventions targeted towards older staff nurses and nursing staff from hospital units that care for patients with delirium and longer lengths of stay are needed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Characteristics of elderspeak communication in hospital dementia care: Findings from The Nurse Talk observational study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shelley Horak","Caitlin Ward"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654992000,"objectID":"e4c0a955426c289b1c043dff229c5b51","permalink":"https://ceward18.github.io/publication/ccapaper/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ccapaper/","section":"publication","summary":"Government supported child care assistance (CCA) programs support low-income families by subsidizing costs of child care for working parents. In the United States, federal policy outlines several goals designed to guide the development and implementation of state CCA programs, however the intended outcomes are difficult to quantify. Without the collection and analysis of data related to the families and providers involved in the program, states are not able to effectively evaluate their success. This leaves program administrators and community advocates without valuable information needed for decision-making. Administrative data collected by the state CCA programs as part of their implementation offers a low-cost and effective approach to assessing program performance and execution, but there is currently no guidance for distilling the large quantities of information existing in these complex records. In this article, we present a novel evaluation framework for using administrative data to evaluate CCA program success guided by both policy and literature.

Improvements in hospital dementia care are needed, and one way to address this need is by identifying factors that lead to RoC, particularly those that are modifiable. Elderspeak communication is an established antecedent to RoC among PLWD in nursing homes. The purpose of this study was to extend these results to acute care settings by determining the impact of elderspeak communication by nursing staff on RoC by hospitalized PLWD.\n\n**Methods**\n\nCare encounters between nursing staff and PLWD were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic features of elderspeak. RoC behaviors was scored in real-time using the Resistiveness to Care Scale. A Bayesian repeated-measures hurdle model was used to evaluate the association between elderspeak and both the presence and severity of RoC.\n\n**Results**\n\nEighty-eight care encounters between 16 PLWD and 53 nursing staff were audio-recorded for elderspeak and scored for RoC. Nearly all (96.6%) of the encounters included some form of elderspeak. Almost half of the care encounters (48.9%) included RoC behaviors. A 10% decrease in elderspeak was associated with a 77% decrease in odds of RoC (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.68) and a 16% decrease ( 0.84, CI = 0.73, 0.96) in the severity of RoC. A one-unit decrease in pain severity was associated with 73% reduced odds of RoC (OR = 0.27, CI = 0.12, 0.45) and a 28% decrease ( 0.72, CI = 0.64, 0.80) in the severity of RoC.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nBoth elderspeak by nursing staff and RoC by PLWD are present and pervasive in acute care.

Furthermore, define $E^\\ast_t$, $I^\\ast_{t}$, and $R^\\ast_{t}$ to represent the number of individuals that transition into the indicated compartment in this interval.\nThe counts of newly exposed, infectious, and removed individuals is modeled using a chain binomial structure:\n$$E^\\ast_t \\sim Bin\\Big(S_t, \\pi_t^{(SE)}\\Big)$$\n$$I^\\ast_{t} \\sim Bin\\Big(E_{t}, \\pi^{(EI)} \\Big)$$\n$$R^\\ast_{t} \\sim Bin\\Big(I_{t}, \\pi^{(IR)} \\Big)$$\nThe transition probabilities, $\\pi_t^{(\\text{SE})}$, $\\pi^{(\\text{EI})}$, and $\\pi^{(\\text{IR})}$ are of primary interest. $\\texttt{BayesSEIR}$ assumes the transmission probability is written as\n$$\\pi_t^{(\\text{SE})} = 1 - \\exp \\Big(-e^{\\theta_t} \\frac{I_t}{N}\\Big)$$\nwhere $\\theta_t = X_t' \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, $X_t$ is a $1 \\times p$ row-vector, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a $p \\times 1$ vector used to describe the intensity process.\n$\\texttt{BayesSEIR}$ uses an exponential distribution to describe the time spent in the latent period, which translates to a probability written as\n$$\\pi^{(\\text{EI})} = 1 - \\exp (- \\rho_E)$$\nwhere $\\rho_E$ is the rate parameter, such that $1/\\rho_E$ gives the mean duration of the latent period.\n$\\texttt{BayesSEIR}$ offers three possible methods for specifying the infectious period:\n  Exponentially distributed: $$\\pi^{(\\text{IR})} = 1 - \\exp (- \\rho_I)$$ where $\\rho_I$ is the rate parameter, such that $1/\\rho_I$ gives the mean duration of the infectious period.\n  Path-specific: $$\\pi^{(\\text{IR})} = P(W \\leq w + 1 | W \u0026gt; w)$$ where $W$ can follow an exponential, gamma, or Weibull distribution.\n  Infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmission: $$\\pi_t^{(\\text{SE})} = 1 - \\exp \\Big(-e^{\\theta_t} \\frac{ \\sum_{w = 1}^{T_I} f(w) I_{wt} }{N} \\Big)$$ where the duration of the infectious period is fixed at $T_I$ days and $f(w) \u0026gt; 0$ describes a curve of transmissibility over each individual\u0026rsquo;s infectious period. BayesSEIR offers four functions that can be used to specify $f(w)$, the gamma PDF, the log normal PDF, a logistic decay function, and a function derived from splines.\n  Examples For some examples of the package in action, check out the package vignettes:\nSimulating Epidemics and Computing R0\n1995 Kikwit Ebola Outbreak\nReferences Lekone, P.

Herein, we compare the diagnostic performance of multiple radiomics-based models to differentiate GBM from PCNSL. Our retrospective study included 94 patients (34 with PCNSL and 60 with GBM). Model performance was assessed using various MRI sequences across 45 possible model and feature selection combinations for nine different sequence permutations. Predictive performance was assessed using fivefold repeated cross-validation with five repeats. The best and worst performing models were compared to assess differences in performance. The predictive performance, both using individual and a combination of sequences, was fairly robust across multiple top performing models (AUC 0.961–0.977) but did show considerable variation between the best and worst performing models. The top performing individual sequences had comparable performance to multiparametric models. The best prediction model in our study used a combination of ADC, FLAIR, and T1-CE achieving the highest AUC of 0.977, while the second ranked model used T1-CE and ADC, achieving a cross-validated AUC of 0.975. Radiomics-based predictive accuracy can vary considerably, based on the model and feature selection methods as well as the combination of sequences used. Also, models derived from limited sequences show performance comparable to those derived from all five sequences.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Radiomics-based Differentiation Between Glioblastoma and Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma A Comparison of Diagnostic Performance Across Different MRI Sequences and Machine Learning Techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarv Priya","Amit Agarwal","Caitlin Ward","Thomas Locke","Varun Monga","Girish Bathla"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613088000,"objectID":"d47d167b13b027e38f73246ffc1f3c6e","permalink":"https://ceward18.github.io/publication/survivalmachinelearning/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/survivalmachinelearning/","section":"publication","summary":" **Objective**\n\nMagnetic resonance texture analysis (MRTA) is a relatively new technique that can be a valuable addition to clinical and imaging parameters in predicting prognosis. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of MRTA for glioblastoma survival using T1 contrast-enhanced (CE) images for texture analysis.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe evaluated the diagnostic performance of multiple machine learning models based on first-order histogram statistical parameters derived from T1-weighted CE images in the survival stratification of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Retrospective evaluation of 85 patients with GBM was performed. Thirty-six first-order texture parameters at six spatial scale filters (SSF) were extracted on the T1 CE axial images for the whole tumor using commercially available research software. Several machine learning classification models (in four broad categories- linear, penalized linear, non-linear, and ensemble classifiers) were evaluated to assess the survival prediction performance using optimal features.Principal component analysis was used prior to fitting the linear classifiers in order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature inputs. Fivefold cross-validation was used to partition the data iteratively into training and testing sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the diagnostic performance.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe neural network model was the highest performing model with the highest observed AUC (0.811) and cross-validated AUC (0.71). The most important variable was the age at diagnosis, with mean and mean of positive pixels (MPP) for SSF=0 being the second and third most important, followed by skewness for SSF=0 and SSF=4.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nFirst-order texture features, when combined with age at presentation, show good accuracy in predicting GBM survival.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Survival prediction in glioblastoma on post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging using filtration based first-order texture analysis- Comparison of multiple machine learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caitlin Ward","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, the same instrument cannot always be used over a period of time to measure that latent ability. This is often the case when measuring traits longitudinally in children. Reasons may be that over time some measurement tools that were difficult for young children become too easy as they age resulting in floor effects or ceiling effects or both. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for such a scenario. Within the Bayesian model we combine information from multiple instruments used at different age ranges and having different scoring schemes to examine growth in latent ability over time. The model includes between-subject variance and within-subject variance and does not require linking item specific difficulty between the measurement tools. The model’s utility is demonstrated on a study of language ability in children from ages one to ten who are hard of hearing where measurement tool specific growth and subject-specific growth are shown in addition to a group level latent growth curve comparing the hard of hearing children to children with normal hearing.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Modeling population and subject-specific growth in a latent trait measured by multiple instruments over time using a hierarchical Bayesian framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carolyn Copps Hartley","Lynette M.

Weaver, Sanders, Campbell, and Schnabel’s Domestic Violence–Related Financial Issues Scale (DV-FI) was developed to assess the role of financial-related issues in an individual’s experiences of IPV as well as perceptions of financial self-efficacy and the future role that financial issues will play in one’s sense of financial security. Despite its relevance to research focused on IPV, only portions of the DV-FI have been used in a handful of studies. The original factor analysis of the DV-FI identified five subscales within a shelter-based sample of impoverished, predominantly African American women. The DV-FI demonstrated good psychometric properties at the time of development; yet, to our knowledge, the factor structure of this measure has not been evaluated with another sample. Given the importance of identifying economic abuse and financial self-efficacy among women who experience IPV, it is essential to have a reliable and valid measure of these constructs. In this article, we describe the results of a confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis of the DV-FI using a community sample of 150 predominantly White, low-income women seeking civil legal services. We identified a four-factor solution of the DV-FI. Our findings provide support for the Financial Self-Efficacy subscale as a domain-specific measure of financial self-efficacy among women who experience IPV, but further validation is needed to explain the divergent findings for the remaining factors.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A New Factor Solution for the Domestic Violence–Related Financial Issues Scale (DV-FI)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to gfdive technical content creators a seamless experience.

In this work, we demonstrate how one state health department worked to create relative risk measures of cancer incidence, late-stage cancer incidence and mortality incidence displayed in an easy to read map using spatio-temporal statistical tools. The data included age, sex, cancer type and stage, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for every incidence and death from 2004 to 2015. Eight types of cancer were selected for analysis - breast, cervical, colorectal, liver, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), prostate, and melanoma. The risk maps were designed to illustrate areas of the state where risk for developing or dying from certain cancers was higher than the state average, and to show how trends are evolving over time. A hierarchical Bayesian log-normal Poisson regression model, with effects for ZCTA, time period, and a space-time interaction was implemented. The spatial effects accounted for spatial correlation using an intrinsic conditional auto-regressive model, and the time effects used an autoregressive model. Through the model, we were able to achieve reliable estimates of relative risk per ZCTA and time period, even for small population ZCTAs with few, if any, cases during the time period. Furthermore, we calculated a measure of risk probability for each ZCTA, relative to the state average. Results from two cancers are discussed in this manuscript, but all 24 results are available on the project website.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Showcasing Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Rural ZCTAs Using Risk Probabilities via Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Disease Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meredith Saletta","Lisa Goffman","Caitlin Ward","Jacob J.

Practiced imitation of a sequence may become rote and require reduced procedural memory. This study explored whether speech motor deficits in children with SLI occur generally or only in conditions of high linguistic load, whether speech motor deficits diminish with practice, and whether it is beneficial to incorporate conditions of high load to understand speech production. Children with SLI and typical development participated in a syntactic priming task during which they generated sentences (high linguistic load) and, then, practiced repeating a sentence (low load) across 3 sessions. We assessed phonetic accuracy, speech movement variability, and duration. Children with SLI produced more variable articulatory movements than peers with typical development in the high load condition. The groups converged in the low load condition. Children with SLI continued to show increased articulatory stability over 3 practice sessions. Both groups produced generated sentences with increased duration and variability compared with repeated sentences. Linguistic demands influence speech motor production. Children with SLI show reduced speech motor performance in tasks that require language generation but not when task demands are reduced in rote practice.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Influence of Language Load on Speech Motor Skill in Children With Specific Language Impairment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://ceward18.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
