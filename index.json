The package offers modelers three methods to describe the infectious period: exponentially distributed, gamma or Weibully distributed using the path-specific approach of Porter and Oleson (2013), and the infectious duration-dependent transmissibility proposed by the package authors.\nModel Details The SEIR model includes four compartments, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed/Recovered. BayesSEIR uses the chain binomial structure as presented in Lekone and Finkenstädt (2006). The model assumes a closed population of size $N$. Let $t = 1, \u0026hellip;, \\tau$ indicate discrete calendar time since the epidemic began and $S_t$, $E_t$, $I_t$, and $R_t$ denote the number of individuals in the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed compartment in the time interval $(t, t+1]$, respectively. Furthermore, define $E^\\ast_t$, $I^\\ast_{t}$, and $R^\\ast_{t}$ to represent the number of individuals that transition into the indicated compartment in this interval.\nThe counts of newly exposed, infectious, and removed individuals is modeled using a chain binomial structure:\n$$E^\\ast_t \\sim Bin\\Big(S_t, \\pi_t^{(SE)}\\Big)$$\n$$I^\\ast_{t} \\sim Bin\\Big(E_{t}, \\pi^{(EI)} \\Big)$$\n$$R^\\ast_{t} \\sim Bin\\Big(I_{t}, \\pi^{(IR)} \\Big)$$\nThe transition probabilities, $\\pi_t^{(\\text{SE})}$, $\\pi^{(\\text{EI})}$, and $\\pi^{(\\text{IR})}$ are of primary interest. $\\texttt{BayesSEIR}$ assumes the transmission probability is written as\n$$\\pi_t^{(\\text{SE})} = 1 - \\exp \\Big(-e^{\\theta_t} \\frac{I_t}{N}\\Big)$$\nwhere $\\theta_t = X_t' \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, $X_t$ is a $1 \\times p$ row-vector, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a $p \\times 1$ vector used to describe the intensity process.\n$\\texttt{BayesSEIR}$ uses an exponential distribution to describe the time spent in the latent period, which translates to a probability written as\n$$\\pi^{(\\text{EI})} = 1 - \\exp (- \\rho_E)$$\nwhere $\\rho_E$ is the rate parameter, such that $1/\\rho_E$ gives the mean duration of the latent period.\n$\\texttt{BayesSEIR}$ offers three possible methods for specifying the infectious period:\n  Exponentially distributed: $$\\pi^{(\\text{IR})} = 1 - \\exp (- \\rho_I)$$ where $\\rho_I$ is the rate parameter, such that $1/\\rho_I$ gives the mean duration of the infectious period.\n  Path-specific: $$\\pi^{(\\text{IR})} = P(W \\leq w + 1 | W \u0026gt; w)$$ where $W$ can follow an exponential, gamma, or Weibull distribution.\n  Infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmission: $$\\pi_t^{(\\text{SE})} = 1 - \\exp \\Big(-e^{\\theta_t} \\frac{ \\sum_{w = 1}^{T_I} f(w) I_{wt} }{N} \\Big)$$ where the duration of the infectious period is fixed at $T_I$ days and $f(w) \u0026gt; 0$ describes a curve of transmissibility over each individual\u0026rsquo;s infectious period. BayesSEIR offers four functions that can be used to specify $f(w)$, the gamma PDF, the log normal PDF, a logistic decay function, and a function derived from splines.\n  Examples For some examples of the package in action, check out the package vignettes:\nSimulating Epidemics and Computing R0\n1995 Kikwit Ebola Outbreak\nReferences Lekone, P.

Herein, we compare the diagnostic performance of multiple radiomics-based models to differentiate GBM from PCNSL. Our retrospective study included 94 patients (34 with PCNSL and 60 with GBM). Model performance was assessed using various MRI sequences across 45 possible model and feature selection combinations for nine different sequence permutations. Predictive performance was assessed using fivefold repeated cross-validation with five repeats. The best and worst performing models were compared to assess differences in performance. The predictive performance, both using individual and a combination of sequences, was fairly robust across multiple top performing models (AUC 0.961–0.977) but did show considerable variation between the best and worst performing models. The top performing individual sequences had comparable performance to multiparametric models. The best prediction model in our study used a combination of ADC, FLAIR, and T1-CE achieving the highest AUC of 0.977, while the second ranked model used T1-CE and ADC, achieving a cross-validated AUC of 0.975. Radiomics-based predictive accuracy can vary considerably, based on the model and feature selection methods as well as the combination of sequences used. Also, models derived from limited sequences show performance comparable to those derived from all five sequences.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Radiomics-based Differentiation Between Glioblastoma and Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma A Comparison of Diagnostic Performance Across Different MRI Sequences and Machine Learning Techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarv Priya","Amit Agarwal","Caitlin Ward","Thomas Locke","Varun Monga","Girish Bathla"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613088000,"objectID":"d47d167b13b027e38f73246ffc1f3c6e","permalink":"https://ceward18.github.io/publication/survivalmachinelearning/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/survivalmachinelearning/","section":"publication","summary":" **Objective**\n\nMagnetic resonance texture analysis (MRTA) is a relatively new technique that can be a valuable addition to clinical and imaging parameters in predicting prognosis. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of MRTA for glioblastoma survival using T1 contrast-enhanced (CE) images for texture analysis.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe evaluated the diagnostic performance of multiple machine learning models based on first-order histogram statistical parameters derived from T1-weighted CE images in the survival stratification of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Retrospective evaluation of 85 patients with GBM was performed. Thirty-six first-order texture parameters at six spatial scale filters (SSF) were extracted on the T1 CE axial images for the whole tumor using commercially available research software. Several machine learning classification models (in four broad categories- linear, penalized linear, non-linear, and ensemble classifiers) were evaluated to assess the survival prediction performance using optimal features.Principal component analysis was used prior to fitting the linear classifiers in order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature inputs. Fivefold cross-validation was used to partition the data iteratively into training and testing sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the diagnostic performance.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe neural network model was the highest performing model with the highest observed AUC (0.811) and cross-validated AUC (0.71). The most important variable was the age at diagnosis, with mean and mean of positive pixels (MPP) for SSF=0 being the second and third most important, followed by skewness for SSF=0 and SSF=4.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nFirst-order texture features, when combined with age at presentation, show good accuracy in predicting GBM survival.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Survival prediction in glioblastoma on post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging using filtration based first-order texture analysis- Comparison of multiple machine learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caitlin Ward","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, the same instrument cannot always be used over a period of time to measure that latent ability. This is often the case when measuring traits longitudinally in children. Reasons may be that over time some measurement tools that were difficult for young children become too easy as they age resulting in floor effects or ceiling effects or both. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for such a scenario. Within the Bayesian model we combine information from multiple instruments used at different age ranges and having different scoring schemes to examine growth in latent ability over time. The model includes between-subject variance and within-subject variance and does not require linking item specific difficulty between the measurement tools. The model’s utility is demonstrated on a study of language ability in children from ages one to ten who are hard of hearing where measurement tool specific growth and subject-specific growth are shown in addition to a group level latent growth curve comparing the hard of hearing children to children with normal hearing.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Modeling population and subject-specific growth in a latent trait measured by multiple instruments over time using a hierarchical Bayesian framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carolyn Copps Hartley","Lynette M.

Weaver, Sanders, Campbell, and Schnabel’s Domestic Violence–Related Financial Issues Scale (DV-FI) was developed to assess the role of financial-related issues in an individual’s experiences of IPV as well as perceptions of financial self-efficacy and the future role that financial issues will play in one’s sense of financial security. Despite its relevance to research focused on IPV, only portions of the DV-FI have been used in a handful of studies. The original factor analysis of the DV-FI identified five subscales within a shelter-based sample of impoverished, predominantly African American women. The DV-FI demonstrated good psychometric properties at the time of development; yet, to our knowledge, the factor structure of this measure has not been evaluated with another sample. Given the importance of identifying economic abuse and financial self-efficacy among women who experience IPV, it is essential to have a reliable and valid measure of these constructs. In this article, we describe the results of a confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis of the DV-FI using a community sample of 150 predominantly White, low-income women seeking civil legal services. We identified a four-factor solution of the DV-FI.

In this work, we demonstrate how one state health department worked to create relative risk measures of cancer incidence, late-stage cancer incidence and mortality incidence displayed in an easy to read map using spatio-temporal statistical tools. The data included age, sex, cancer type and stage, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for every incidence and death from 2004 to 2015. Eight types of cancer were selected for analysis - breast, cervical, colorectal, liver, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), prostate, and melanoma. The risk maps were designed to illustrate areas of the state where risk for developing or dying from certain cancers was higher than the state average, and to show how trends are evolving over time. A hierarchical Bayesian log-normal Poisson regression model, with effects for ZCTA, time period, and a space-time interaction was implemented. The spatial effects accounted for spatial correlation using an intrinsic conditional auto-regressive model, and the time effects used an autoregressive model. Through the model, we were able to achieve reliable estimates of relative risk per ZCTA and time period, even for small population ZCTAs with few, if any, cases during the time period. Furthermore, we calculated a measure of risk probability for each ZCTA, relative to the state average. Results from two cancers are discussed in this manuscript, but all 24 results are available on the project website.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Showcasing Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Rural ZCTAs Using Risk Probabilities via Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Disease Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meredith Saletta","Lisa Goffman","Caitlin Ward","Jacob J.

Practiced imitation of a sequence may become rote and require reduced procedural memory. This study explored whether speech motor deficits in children with SLI occur generally or only in conditions of high linguistic load, whether speech motor deficits diminish with practice, and whether it is beneficial to incorporate conditions of high load to understand speech production. Children with SLI and typical development participated in a syntactic priming task during which they generated sentences (high linguistic load) and, then, practiced repeating a sentence (low load) across 3 sessions. We assessed phonetic accuracy, speech movement variability, and duration. Children with SLI produced more variable articulatory movements than peers with typical development in the high load condition. The groups converged in the low load condition. Children with SLI continued to show increased articulatory stability over 3 practice sessions. Both groups produced generated sentences with increased duration and variability compared with repeated sentences. Linguistic demands influence speech motor production. Children with SLI show reduced speech motor performance in tasks that require language generation but not when task demands are reduced in rote practice.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Influence of Language Load on Speech Motor Skill in Children With Specific Language Impairment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://ceward18.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
