  <meta name="description" content="Mycoplasma bovis outbreaks in cattle, including pathogen spread between age groups, are not well understood. Our objective was to estimate within-herd transmission across adult dairy cows, youngstock and calves. Results from 3 tests (PCR, ELISA, and culture) per cow and 2 tests (PCR and ELISA) per youngstock and calf were utilized in an age-stratified Susceptible-Infected-Removed/Recovered (SIR) model to estimate within-herd transmission parameters, pathways, and potential effects of farm management practices. A cohort of adult cows, youngstock and calves on 20 Dutch dairy farms with a clinical outbreak of M. bovis in adult cows were sampled, with collection of blood, conjunctival fluid and milk from cows, and blood and conjunctival fluid from calves and youngstock, 5 times over a timespan of 12 wk. Any individual with at least 1 positive laboratory test was considered M. bovis-positive. Transmission dynamics were modeled using an age-stratified SIR model featuring 3 age strata. Associations with farm management practices were explored using Fisher&#39;s Exact tests and Poisson regression. Estimated transmission parameters were highly variable among herds and cattle-age groups. Notably, transmission from cows to cows, youngstock, or to calves was associated with R-values ranging from 1.0 to 80 secondarily infected cows per herd, 1.2 to 38 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, and 0.1 to 91 secondarily infected calves per herd, respectively. In case of transmission from youngstock to youngstock, calves or to cows, R-values were 0.7 to 96 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, 1.1 to 76 secondarily infected calves per herd, and 0.1 to 107 secondarily infected cows per herd. For transmission from calves to calves, youngstock or to cows, R-values were 0.5 to 60 secondarily infected calves per herd, 1.1 to 41 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, and 0.1 to 47 secondarily infected cows per herd. Among on-farm transmission pathways, cow-to-youngstock, cow-to-calf and cow-to-cow were identified as most significant contributors, with calf-to-calf and calf-to-youngstock also having noteworthy roles. Youngstock-to-youngstock was also implicated, albeit to a lesser extent. Whereas the primary focus was a clinical outbreak of M. bovis among adult dairy cows, it was evident that transmission extended to calves and youngstock, contributing to overall spread. Factors influencing transmission and specific transmission pathways were associated with internal biosecurity (separate caretakers for various age groups, number of people involved), external biosecurity (contractors, external employees), as well as indirect transmission routes (number of feed and water stations)." />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Mycoplasma bovis outbreaks in cattle, including pathogen spread between age groups, are not well understood. Our objective was to estimate within-herd transmission across adult dairy cows, youngstock and calves. Results from 3 tests (PCR, ELISA, and culture) per cow and 2 tests (PCR and ELISA) per youngstock and calf were utilized in an age-stratified Susceptible-Infected-Removed/Recovered (SIR) model to estimate within-herd transmission parameters, pathways, and potential effects of farm management practices. A cohort of adult cows, youngstock and calves on 20 Dutch dairy farms with a clinical outbreak of M. bovis in adult cows were sampled, with collection of blood, conjunctival fluid and milk from cows, and blood and conjunctival fluid from calves and youngstock, 5 times over a timespan of 12 wk. Any individual with at least 1 positive laboratory test was considered M. bovis-positive. Transmission dynamics were modeled using an age-stratified SIR model featuring 3 age strata. Associations with farm management practices were explored using Fisher&rsquo;s Exact tests and Poisson regression. Estimated transmission parameters were highly variable among herds and cattle-age groups. Notably, transmission from cows to cows, youngstock, or to calves was associated with R-values ranging from 1.0 to 80 secondarily infected cows per herd, 1.2 to 38 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, and 0.1 to 91 secondarily infected calves per herd, respectively. In case of transmission from youngstock to youngstock, calves or to cows, R-values were 0.7 to 96 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, 1.1 to 76 secondarily infected calves per herd, and 0.1 to 107 secondarily infected cows per herd. For transmission from calves to calves, youngstock or to cows, R-values were 0.5 to 60 secondarily infected calves per herd, 1.1 to 41 secondarily infected youngstock per herd, and 0.1 to 47 secondarily infected cows per herd. Among on-farm transmission pathways, cow-to-youngstock, cow-to-calf and cow-to-cow were identified as most significant contributors, with calf-to-calf and calf-to-youngstock also having noteworthy roles. Youngstock-to-youngstock was also implicated, albeit to a lesser extent. Whereas the primary focus was a clinical outbreak of M. bovis among adult dairy cows, it was evident that transmission extended to calves and youngstock, contributing to overall spread. Factors influencing transmission and specific transmission pathways were associated with internal biosecurity (separate caretakers for various age groups, number of people involved), external biosecurity (contractors, external employees), as well as indirect transmission routes (number of feed and water stations).</p>
