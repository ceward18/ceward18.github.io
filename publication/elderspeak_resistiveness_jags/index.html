  <meta name="description" content=" **Background**

Rejection of care (RoC) occurs when persons living with dementia (PLWD) withstand or oppose the efforts of their caregiver. Improvements in hospital dementia care are needed, and one way to address this need is by identifying factors that lead to RoC, particularly those that are modifiable. Elderspeak communication is an established antecedent to RoC among PLWD in nursing homes. The purpose of this study was to extend these results to acute care settings by determining the impact of elderspeak communication by nursing staff on RoC by hospitalized PLWD.

**Methods**

Care encounters between nursing staff and PLWD were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic features of elderspeak. RoC behaviors was scored in real-time using the Resistiveness to Care Scale. A Bayesian repeated-measures hurdle model was used to evaluate the association between elderspeak and both the presence and severity of RoC.

**Results**

Eighty-eight care encounters between 16 PLWD and 53 nursing staff were audio-recorded for elderspeak and scored for RoC. Nearly all (96.6%) of the encounters included some form of elderspeak. Almost half of the care encounters (48.9%) included RoC behaviors. A 10% decrease in elderspeak was associated with a 77% decrease in odds of RoC (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.68) and a 16% decrease ( 0.84, CI = 0.73, 0.96) in the severity of RoC. A one-unit decrease in pain severity was associated with 73% reduced odds of RoC (OR = 0.27, CI = 0.12, 0.45) and a 28% decrease ( 0.72, CI = 0.64, 0.80) in the severity of RoC.

**Conclusions**

Both elderspeak by nursing staff and RoC by PLWD are present and pervasive in acute care. Pain and elderspeak are two modifiable factors of RoC in hospitalized PLWD. Person-centered interventions are needed that address communication practices and pain management for hospitalized PLWD." />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract"><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Rejection of care (RoC) occurs when persons living with dementia (PLWD) withstand or oppose the efforts of their caregiver. Improvements in hospital dementia care are needed, and one way to address this need is by identifying factors that lead to RoC, particularly those that are modifiable. Elderspeak communication is an established antecedent to RoC among PLWD in nursing homes. The purpose of this study was to extend these results to acute care settings by determining the impact of elderspeak communication by nursing staff on RoC by hospitalized PLWD.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>Care encounters between nursing staff and PLWD were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic features of elderspeak. RoC behaviors was scored in real-time using the Resistiveness to Care Scale. A Bayesian repeated-measures hurdle model was used to evaluate the association between elderspeak and both the presence and severity of RoC.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Eighty-eight care encounters between 16 PLWD and 53 nursing staff were audio-recorded for elderspeak and scored for RoC. Nearly all (96.6%) of the encounters included some form of elderspeak. Almost half of the care encounters (48.9%) included RoC behaviors. A 10% decrease in elderspeak was associated with a 77% decrease in odds of RoC (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.68) and a 16% decrease ( 0.84, CI = 0.73, 0.96) in the severity of RoC. A one-unit decrease in pain severity was associated with 73% reduced odds of RoC (OR = 0.27, CI = 0.12, 0.45) and a 28% decrease ( 0.72, CI = 0.64, 0.80) in the severity of RoC.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>Both elderspeak by nursing staff and RoC by PLWD are present and pervasive in acute care. Pain and elderspeak are two modifiable factors of RoC in hospitalized PLWD. Person-centered interventions are needed that address communication practices and pain management for hospitalized PLWD.</p>
