Welcome! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Calgary studying 
behavioral change in infectious disease systems under the supervision of Dr. Rob
Deardon and Dr. Alex Schmidt. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics
at the University of Iowa in 2021, where I worked with Dr. Grant Brown and Dr.
Jacob Oleson to develop methodology to create more accurate models of infectious
diseases. I am interested in Bayesian statistics and computation, and have found
applications in epidemic spread, latent growth modeling, and disease mapping.

At the University of Iowa, I spent four years working at the Biostatistics 
Consulting Center, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers
in a wide range of disciplines, including radiology, nursing, communication 
sciences, and social work. Many of my recent collaborative publications have 
centered on using machine learning methods and radiomics data for tumor 
classification. Other collaborative projects I've worked on have used
longitudinal methods, network analysis, in addition to traditional regression
modeling.

I hold a strong passion for teaching biostatistics curriculum using 
personalized pedagogical methods. This led to applying and receiving funding 
for the creation of an Open Educational Resource (OER) to be used in an 
introductory biostatistics or statistics course. The OER is currently under 
construction, with development focused on the combination of textual 
explanations, embedded Shiny applications, and corresponding exercises which 
ephasize conceptual understanding. This will provide students with an engaging 
and interactive learning resource that offers an intuitive illustration of core
statistical concepts.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, baking, and all things 
volleyball related.
